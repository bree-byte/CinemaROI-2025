## The Problem Statement 

Investors repeatedly ask indie filmmakers six specific questions. This project answers **all six** using real data from 12,000+ films (2020 – Nov 2025):

| # | Research Question You Answered with Charts                                                                 
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 1 | Which movie genres yield the highest ROI?                                                                         
| 2 | Which genres are critically acclaimed versus financially successful?                                            
| 3 | Which directors consistently produce profitable movies                                                          
| 4 | Which actors repeatedly contribute to high ROI projects                                                        
| 5 | Which genres are oversaturated, and which are underserved yet lucrative (saturation vs opportunity)?           
| 6 | How do yearly trends in genres (especially animation) affect potential investment decisions?                    



## Key Insights 

- **Horror** remains the most profitable genre at 5.05× average ROI  
- **Animation** delivers both high audience love (7.2/10) **and** strong ROI (3.87×)  
- **Mystery** is the most underserved high-ROI niche — perfect for indie differentiation  
- Top 5 actors by ROI are all supporting/voice performers in billion-dollar franchises (MCU & Illumination cameos can boost a film’s ROI by 3–7×  
- Animation’s 2021 crash and 2023–2025 explosion is the clearest trend in the entire dataset  
- Action & Comedy are the most oversaturated with only modest returns
